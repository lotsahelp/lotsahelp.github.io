<div class="MsoNormal">The last weekend of February, my wife and I moved from Northwest Arkansas down to Charleston, South Carolina. During the process of unloading the truck and the long, sporadic process of unpacking I started to think about what moving has in common with a software platform migration. In this case, a platform migration can be a big thing like moving from .NET to PHP and SQL Server to Oracle for example. It could also be a small exercise as just upgrading platform versions.</div>
<h2>Several Options on How</h2>
<div class="MsoNormal">When moving, you have several methods to get from point A to B. I started to think of these in terms of outsourcing for this particular job.</div>
<ul>
<li>Use your cars (Do it all yourself)</li>
<li>Rent a truck (Get a better tool)</li>
<li>Rent a trailer and driver (Get a better tool and support)</li>
<li>Have someone load and drive (Outsource and you handle the details, just not the heavy lifting)</li>
<li>Have someone pack, load, and drive (Outsource and they do everything)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you go down the list, the price goes up, but your workload decreases. It all depends on how much time and effort versus money you want to spend on this. We chose to have someone load our stuff and drive it down, then unload. We did not want the hassle of moving all the stuff we had as far as we needed to move it. Our choice was worth it.
<div class="MsoNormal">Similarly, getting better tools or outsourcing the work might be worth the price paid. As with any move, make sure who you outsource to has a good reputation. Get references and call them if you can and do your homework. Would you trust what could essentially be your company&rsquo;s household to these people? Remember that outsourcing is not always a bad thing; it might make sense in your situation.</div>
<h2>We've Got Too Much Stuff</h2>
<div class="MsoNormal">As with every move, realization hits that you don&rsquo;t need to move everything you have. You would rather sell or donate some or many of the stuff you are going to have to move otherwise. The more stuff you have to move, the more expensive and time consuming.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Software is much the same way, though you can&rsquo;t sell pieces off at a garage sale. It is a good idea when doing a migration to evaluate all functionality to see if you can lose some pieces or replace them with what is built in to the new platform.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">This problem is also a good incentive for keeping your software as slim and narrowly focused as possible. Every piece of functionality is potential bloat that could increase migration or upgrade costs, especially if that functionality is rarely or never used.</div>
<h2>Unpacking</h2>
<div class="MsoNormal">So now that you&rsquo;ve moved, it&rsquo;s time to unpack. This is when you get to start opening boxes and hope you have a place for all the stuff. You also get to find out what got broken or lost in the move. This is where having an inventory comes in real handy.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">You get to do the same thing with the software you&rsquo;ve migrated. Is there enough space and processing power? What functionality works, what&rsquo;s broken? Did we move everything over we were supposed to? Again, an inventory really helps here, but in this case, the inventory can be a set of unit tests or functional tests. Run your tests if you have them, if not, you&rsquo;ll only figure out what&rsquo;s broken when you try to use it for the first time.</div>
<h2>Might we Move Again?</h2>
<div class="MsoNormal">If you move once, how likely are you to move again? We know we will. Hopefully later rather than sooner, but our history doesn&rsquo;t suggest that. We are already preparing for the next move. Selling now what we couldn&rsquo;t sell before we moved. Doing everything we can to reduce the amount of stuff we own. We are saving packing material from this move for the next one, reducing that cost. Hopefully we are learning from this experience to make the next one smoother.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">One of the best things that can be done after a move is a Post Mortem. Take the time with who was responsible for the move and document what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. This might happen again, so learn from your experience and save that knowledge. Keep trimming unneeded features if possible. Prepare for the next move.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">One other thing; take a post-move break. Moving is hard work. A lot of times, it gets time crunched at the end. Don&rsquo;t forget to reward yourself after the job is done. Take the time to celebrate victory and congratulate those involved.</div>

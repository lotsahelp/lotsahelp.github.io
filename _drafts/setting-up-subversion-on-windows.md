<p>The first thing you'll need to have in order to source control your databases is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">revision control system</a>. Personally, I like <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>&nbsp;(SVN) right now because it is good quality and free as it is open source. Currently, since all our servers are running Windows, we chose a distribution of SVN suitable for that platform. CollabNet offers a <a href="http://www.collab.net/downloads/subversion/">Windows install</a> for the server as well as commercial support if you need it.</p>

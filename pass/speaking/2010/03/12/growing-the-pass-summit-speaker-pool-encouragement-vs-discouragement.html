<meta name="description" content="Allen Kinsel and Jeremiah Peschka recently posted about growing the pool of speakers for the PASS Summit. Instead of worrying about limiting current presenters, we need to encourage new ones. How about forming mentoring program? I want to get better at speaking so that I could, in a year or two, try to present at the summit. Unfortunately, I need someone, other than myself, pushing me to speak AND providing honest feedback and encouragement. It&#39;s tough to speak at a user group and get absolutely no feedback. Having just recently moved to an area with a minimally functioning PASS chapter and .NET user group, opportunities are rarer. Why not start a fund to help with local travel. Offer to pay for gas and find volunteers that would offer their couch for an overnight stay. There are people out there that want to gain the experience necessary. Let&#39;s find them, encourage and enable them to do so. We need to invest in the future." />

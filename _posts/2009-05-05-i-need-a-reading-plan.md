A couple of weeks ago some guys from my team and I decided to do a study group for .NET 3.5 certification. I already had my MCSA (2003) and MCDBA (2000) certs so I figured I would at least update my SQL to 2005 at the same time since my interest has flourished in that area. I also have another, albeit short, book I'm reading to understand business drivers. So, I have 3 books I'm trying to read all at the same time. I need a plan.

I chose SQL 2005 since that is what my company mainly uses. I will then upgrade to 2008 to prepare for the future.

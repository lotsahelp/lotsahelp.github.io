<p>Today was the first day of my first <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com">SQLskills</a> event. The event is 5 8 hour days of intense, master level SQL training. This particular event is on Internals &amp; Performance. Lucky for me, it's being held in Dallas so I don't have to travel for it.</p>
<p>I plan on blogging my impressions for the day every evening. We'll see if I can stick to that. But without further&nbsp;adieu, my first day.</p>
<h3>General Impressions</h3>
<p>Paul (<a href="http://sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/">blog</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/PaulRandal">twitter</a>)&nbsp;and Kimberly (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/Kimberly/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/KimberlyLTripp">twitter</a>) are great facilitators. Paul taught all of today, so I cannot really talk to Kimberly's teaching... yet. Kimberly handled logistics today. &nbsp;I was having admin issues with the hotel wireless that she helped solve. Paul &amp; Kimberly both would field any question that was presented... as long as it involved sheep. I was also curious if Paul ever tired of the sheep jokes. He doesn't, so keep 'em coming.</p>
<h3>Session Impressions</h3>
<p>Breakfast was great. So many conferences or events are catered&nbsp;mediocre&nbsp;at best. The selection for breakfast was a nice variety of food... including the all important bacon. They also more than just coffee and water which is nice since I don't drink coffee. Thanks to SQL Sentry for sponsoring the food.</p>
<p>The first half of the day was all about data structures. It&nbsp;had a good, quick pace, until we got into viewing hex dumps of data pages. I know it's important to learn, just tedious. Data structures are all about how data rows are physically manifested on disk. Also how they are logically built. What the&nbsp;structure&nbsp;hierarchy&nbsp;is. How data compression / sparse columns work.</p>
<p>Lunch was again good food. I hope the food stays this good for the rest of the week. The quality of the food&nbsp;makes a difference in how you feel during the next few hours.</p>
<p>The afternoon was a little more data structures and then data file internals. Again, good quick pace. More about why shrink is bad. Suggestions on where to place data / log files. How SQL Server allocates space. And tempdb.&nbsp;Interesting thing I learned this afternoon was that there are objects in SQL Server that you can only query if you are using the dedicated admin connection (DAC).</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Having already viewed the related MCM videos, today was a lot of refreshment / reinforcment of what I had previously watched. The difference being the depth and time taken on each topic.&nbsp;I really like rapid pace classes. It gives me less chance to get sleepy, which is usually a problem for me in a classroom setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Brian D Knight (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BrianDKnight">twitter</a>), not <em>that </em>Brian Knight, said: "The whiteboard instruction alone at the&nbsp;<a title="#sqlskills" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sqlskills">#sqlskills</a> Immersion Event is worth the price of admission over just watching the MCM videos."</p>

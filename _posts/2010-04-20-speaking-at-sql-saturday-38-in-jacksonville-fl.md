<p>I&rsquo;ve been selected as a last minute speaker for <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/38/eventhome.aspx">SQL Saturday</a>. I&rsquo;ll be speaking on Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) and why they can be a good thing, if properly used. There is an intense debate between application developers that really want to use them and DBAs that despise their existence. Like every tool, it has its place, but can be misused.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll be in Jacksonville on Saturday, May 8th stop by for a great day of SQL learning.</p>

Hello, my name is Eric Humphrey and I work for a software company in Shreveport, LA. My primary focus is data. Currently migrating my skills and data from Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx">SQL Server</a> to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. My intention is to publish some things learned from this migration. I also tend to find useful software and will mention these finds.

Hopefully someone will get some information out of all this.

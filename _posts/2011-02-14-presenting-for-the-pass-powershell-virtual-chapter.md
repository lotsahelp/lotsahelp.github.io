<p>On Wednesday, February 16 at 2:00pm CST I'll be presenting ".NET Powers Activate! Form of PowerShell!" to the <a href="http://powershell.sqlpass.org/">PASS PowerShell Virtual Chapter</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>PowerShell&rsquo;s cmdlets can be pretty powerful on their own, but that&rsquo;s only part of the power of PowerShell. The .NET Framework is the basis of the PowerShell environment. As such, you have a vast library of operations at your disposal. Learn to use its abilities and save the day without needing a monkey with a bucket.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here are the files to go along with the presentation. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/NET-Powers-Activate-Form-of-PowerShell.zip">.NET Powers Activate! Form of PowerShell!</a></p>

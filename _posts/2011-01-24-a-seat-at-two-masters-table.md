<p>Since this is Paul and Kimberly judging, I'll be writing it explicitly for them as "It Depends."</p>
<p>So, if their judging style is based on humor along with Paul / Kimberly / Brent / SQL memes, then here is that entry.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come on, it's Paul and Kimberly, one of the greatest sheep herders ever along with the greatest sheep herder herder. Wouldn't you want to take the&nbsp;opportunity to learn how sheep can be trained to process that much data that fast. There might even be a green fisted Lady Gaga impersonator punching the bacon harder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After the class, I'd love to go around helping others get the best performance out of their livestock. So many have problems with corrupt sheep or dead sheep and there's just not enough of the snippy Scotsman to go around. I'd like to also use it as a starting point to becoming a Certified Master in Sheep Query Lawn Server.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if they are judging on technical merit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I want to learn everything I can about the tool I chose to base my profession on. Paul &amp; Kimberly are recognized as some of the most knowledgeable persons about the internals of that tool. The pair are also very good at teaching and spreading the wisdom and experience they have gained. If I can gleam a portion of that, then I can enhance my performance as a SQL Server professional. This would also be a large first step on becoming an MCM for SQL Server.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One thing I really like doing is helping people. I like solving peoples' troubles who cannot do so themselves. It's something I've done as long as I can remember. I want to take the knowledge gained and use it to help people. I know that companies are usually the ones that require the technical help. Those companies are made up of people trying to do what they do best, but maybe can't learn this material at the depth we can. The people suffer if the company does.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another way to help is to teach others. Professionals like to learn. Teaching a professional or an eager student is a wonderful experience. Knowing that you taught them something new, clarified a portion of thought, or brought a new perspective is very rewarding.&nbsp;This training would help me be a deeper tome from which others can learn.</p>
<p>So Paul, Kim... I'd like a seat at your table when you come to Dallas.</p>

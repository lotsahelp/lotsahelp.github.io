<p>As a follow-up to my <a href="http://www.erichumphrey.com/2010/12/download-the-mcm-readiness-videos-with-powershell/">previous</a> <a href="http://www.erichumphrey.com/2010/12/download-the-mcm-readiness-videos-with-powershell-now-with-bits/">posts</a>: I now present a script to get the <a href="http://sqlbits.com/events/event7/SQLBitsVII.aspx">SqlBits7 Videos</a> using PowerShell and the power of BITS. I will upload the script as a file later tonight.</p>
<p>*** Edit: At the request of Simon Sabin, I have removed my script. I don't want to unfairly drain their bandwidth. ***</p>

<p><a href="http://www.allenkinsel.com/archive/2010/03/growing-the-pool-of-speakers/">Allen Kinsel</a> and <a href="http://facility9.com/2010/03/12/how-can-we-grow-the-pool-of-summit-speakers">Jeremiah Peschka</a> recently posted about growing the pool of speakers for the PASS Summit.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about limiting current presenters, we need to encourage new ones. How about forming mentoring program? I want to get better at speaking so that I could, in a year or two, try to present at the summit. Unfortunately, I need someone, other than myself, pushing me to speak AND providing honest feedback and encouragement. It's tough to speak at a user group and get absolutely no feedback. </p>
<p>Having just recently moved to an area with a minimally functioning PASS chapter and .NET user group, opportunities are rarer. Why not start a fund to help with local travel. Offer to pay for gas and find volunteers that would offer their couch for an overnight stay.</p>
<p>There are people out there that want to gain the experience necessary. Let's find them, encourage and enable them to do so. We need to invest in the future.</p>

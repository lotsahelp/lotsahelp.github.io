  content: 'Eric,<br /><br />I&#39;m right there with you about encouraging the new
    ones.  I probably wouldn&#39;t be speaking anywhere near as much as I do today
    if people hadn&#39;t kept asking me "hey when are you going to speak?"<br /><br
    />To that end, I&#39;d love for you to join us out at SQL Saturday #41 in Atlanta
    next month, call for speakers closes in 2 weeks:  http://bit.ly/by6BNV<br /><br
    />And it sounds like you want something like the Speaker&#39;s Bureau too.  I
    myself hope this effort gains steam:  http://www.sqlandy.com/archive/pass-update-22-speaker-bureau-call-for-comments/'

    Jacksonville, but may be going to a concert in the other direction.'

  content: Eric,  <br /><br />I think the mentoring idea is a great idea and would
    be something that PASS should pursue.  It is tough starting out in speaking and
    learning what you need to do.  I would also suggest to find out if you have a
    Local ToastMasters group around you.  (http://www.toastmasters.org/MainMenuCategories/WhatisToastmasters.aspx)   We
    have one here at my office that helps people to learn how to speak in public.  I
    really haven&#39;t attended one of these events yet because of time constraints
    but it sounds like a great way to learn about public speaking.  <br /><br />Pat

<p><a href="http://www.allenkinsel.com/archive/2010/03/growing-the-pool-of-speakers/">Allen Kinsel</a> and <a href="http://facility9.com/2010/03/12/how-can-we-grow-the-pool-of-summit-speakers">Jeremiah Peschka</a> recently posted about growing the pool of speakers for the PASS Summit.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about limiting current presenters, we need to encourage new ones. How about forming mentoring program? I want to get better at speaking so that I could, in a year or two, try to present at the summit. Unfortunately, I need someone, other than myself, pushing me to speak AND providing honest feedback and encouragement. It's tough to speak at a user group and get absolutely no feedback. </p>
<p>Having just recently moved to an area with a minimally functioning PASS chapter and .NET user group, opportunities are rarer. Why not start a fund to help with local travel. Offer to pay for gas and find volunteers that would offer their couch for an overnight stay.</p>
<p>There are people out there that want to gain the experience necessary. Let's find them, encourage and enable them to do so. We need to invest in the future.</p>

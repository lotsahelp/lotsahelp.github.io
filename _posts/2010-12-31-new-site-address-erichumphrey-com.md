<p>So I finally bit the bullet and migrated from Blogger to WordPress. I'm having a few issues getting redirects from old posts to new posts working. Hopefully those should be fixed this weekend. But now I can start doing cool stuff such as syntax highlighting in code and providing a mobile version of my site.</p>
<p>The new url for my site is <a href="http://www.erichumphrey.com">http://www.erichumphrey.com/</a></p>

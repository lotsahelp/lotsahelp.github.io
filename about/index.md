<p><img class="alignleft" title="My Photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/67783160/DSC_2419.jpg" alt="" height="128" />I work with Point of Sale systems at a regional theme park operator based out of Texas. I specialize in SQL Server with experience in several different programming languages and database platforms.</p>
<p>I am passionate about the SQL and .NET developer communities. I enjoy presenting SQL related topics and enticing users to see what is possible with technology.</p>
